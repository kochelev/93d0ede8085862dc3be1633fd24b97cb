Installation
=============


You can always download/clone it from Github:

.. code::

	git clone https://github.com/operatorequals/covertutils
	cd covertutils
	python setup.py install 	# this one may need root privileges

It is also available in PyPI, but I cannot guarantee that it will be the last version.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/covertutils/

.. code::

	pip install covertutils


Finally, the *makefile* in the git repo may contain useful commands, like *"compile"*. It may be wise to give it a look.
Try compiling the *example* code located at *examples/* directory in github repo.
